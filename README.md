# "Movie Store" (Spring 2010)
This is the final project for the intermediate / advanced C++ course at the University of Washington Bothell.

The purpose of the program is to emulate a movie store complete with an inventory of items and a customer "database".  It made use of several concepts learned during the two C++ courses including linked lists, hash tables, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.

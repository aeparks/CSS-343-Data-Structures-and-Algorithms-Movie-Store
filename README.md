# CSS 343 : "Movie Store"
Written as the final project for CSS 343 : Data Structures, Algorithms, and Discrete Math II -- the intermediate / advanced C++ programming course -- at the University of Washington | Bothell.

# Premise
The purpose of this project was to emulate the needs and typical transation of a movie rental store.  This included a customer "database" and an inventory "database".  In the case of this project, the databases were constructed using linked lists sorted when inserted. The project made use of several key concepts learned during the course including linked lists, operator overloading, inheritance, hash tables, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation.
